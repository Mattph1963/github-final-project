Simple Interest Calculator
This program calculates the simple interest based on the provided inputs:

Input:
p: Principal amount (Initial investment)
t: Time period (in years)
r: Annual rate of interest (as a percentage)
Output:
The program will calculate and display the Simple Interest using the formula:

Simple Interest

Simple Interest=p×t×r
Where:

p is the principal amount.
t is the time period in years.
r is the annual rate of interest.
Example: If you input:

Principal amount (p) = 1000
Time period (t) = 2 years
Annual rate of interest (r) = 5%
The program will calculate the simple interest as:

Simple Interest
